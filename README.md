##Disability Right Mississippi Voting Rights Website.


This repo is for the new voting rights website for Disability Rights Mississippi, a private non-profit organization with a federal mandate to advocate for the rights of people living with disabilities in Mississippi and protect them from abuse and neglect. This site will replace a current website on the same topic made in a WYSIWYG generator at SquareSpace.

The website is mostly static and is intended to provide information about voting for people with disabilities in Mississippi. Included are videos about the importance of voting from the perspective of people with disabilities, information about election law in the state, information about registering to vote, information about locating one's polling place, links to important state government websites regarding voting, and a form to contact Disability Rights Mississippi to request advocacy services, further information about voting, or even legal representation.

All HTML, CSS and JavaScript on this website was written from scratch. The site is responsive and should work well on mobile devices. The server is written in Node.js and Express.js and uses nodemailer and body-parser packages to generate email messages from user submitted form data.

This website is a work in progress and is currently under review for compliance with WCAG 2.0/2.1 guidelines. However, the current site is compatible with screen readers at a basic level, and is fully navigable via the keyboard.
